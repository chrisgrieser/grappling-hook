## Commands

### Bookmark cycler
Goes to your most recently modified bookmarked note. If you are already at a
bookmarked note, goes to the next bookmarked note, in order of the last
modification date. This allows you to quickly cycle between a core set of files
that are important. The command works well for workflows where you work with a
dynamic core set of main notes and many auxiliary notes.

When you have text selected, the bookmark cycler switches to its alternative
mode, and copies the selected text to the last modified bookmarked note,
regardless the note you are.

> [!NOTE]
> Only bookmarked *files* are considered. Bookmarked *blocks* or *headers* are ignored.

*This command is inspired by the [Harpoon plugin for neovim](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon).*

### Alternate note
Go to the last file you were at. As opposed to the `Navigate Back` command,
using the `Switch to Alternate Note` command moves you forward in history when
you press it the second time. This allows you to rapidly switch between two
files with only one hotkey. *This command is equivalent to vim's `:buffer #`.*  

The name of the alternate file is also displayed in
the status bar. If the alternate file is already open in another tab, it 
switches to that tab. If not, the alternate file is opened in the current tab.

### Cycle tab/split
Like the Obsidian built-in command `Go to next tab`, but includes tabs in other
splits, meaning you can cycle through *all* open tabs with one hotkey. 
*This command similar to vim's `:<C-w>w`.* 

### Next/previous file in current folder
Cycles through all files in the current folder, in alphabetical order.

### Open first URL in file
Opens the first URL (external link) found in the file. This includes the
frontmatter. Currently, works only in Source Mode and Live Preview.

Note that this only works with URLs that are *actually* in the file, meaning URLs
displayed via dataview or embedded notes are not supported.

## About the developer
In my day job, I am a sociologist studying the social mechanisms underlying the

economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and
